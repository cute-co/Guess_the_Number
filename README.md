# 🎯 Guess the Number Game

A fun and interactive "Guess the Number" game built using **HTML** and **JavaScript**.

## 🧠 Game Concept

In this game, the computer randomly selects a number, and your goal is to guess it correctly.

### 🔍 How It Works:
- The game generates a random number within a predefined range (e.g., 1 to 100).
- The user enters a number as a guess.
- If the guess is correct, the game ends with a congratulatory message.
- If the guess is **less than** the actual number, the game gives a hint:  
  _"The number is greater than your guess."_
- If the guess is **greater than** the actual number, it hints:  
  _"The number is less than your guess."_
